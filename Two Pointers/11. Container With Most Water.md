Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note**: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example**:
```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

**code:**

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxArea = function(height) {
    var maxarea=0,l=0,r=height.length-1;
    while(l<r) {
        maxarea=Math.max(maxarea,Math.min(height[l],height[r])*(r-l));
        if (height[l]<height[r]) l++;
        else r--;
    }
    return maxarea;
};

```
