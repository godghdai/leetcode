Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note**:

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example**:

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

**code**:

```js

/**
 * @param {number[]} numbers
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(numbers, target) {
    var len=numbers.length;
    var i=0,left,right,mid,findNum;
    while(i<len){
        left=i+1;
        right=len-1;
        findNum=target-numbers[i];
        while(left<=right){
            mid=left+Math.floor((right-left)/2);
            if(numbers[mid]==findNum)
                return [i+1,mid+1];

            if(findNum<numbers[mid])
                right=mid-1;
            else 
                left=mid+1;            
        }
        i++;
    }
    return [];
};

```
